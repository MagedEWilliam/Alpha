This is an e-commerce website, the objective here is to explore what php alone can do (no WP or framework).

This project was never completed hence openedsourced, it was written by one developer and will be refactored and polished.

This website has a simple CMS also open sourced you can find it [here](https://github.com/MagedEWilliam/AlphaCMS).

You can see some of the features in gif on [behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/47745881/Alpha-e-commerce-website-with-a-small-CMS).
